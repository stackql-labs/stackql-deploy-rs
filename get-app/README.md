# get-stackql-deploy.io

Cloudflare Worker that backs `https://get-stackql-deploy.io`. It detects the
calling platform and points the caller at the correct `stackql-deploy` release
asset on GitHub.

Behaviour (unchanged from the previous Deno Deploy app):

- `GET /` - reads the `User-Agent` and `302`-redirects to the matching release
  asset (`windows-x86_64.zip`, `macos-universal.tar.gz`, or
  `linux-x86_64.tar.gz`). Keeps the
  `curl -L https://get-stackql-deploy.io | tar xzf -` one-liner working.
- `GET /install` - universal installer. Detects the calling shell from the
  User-Agent and serves the matching script: the POSIX `sh` installer for
  curl/wget, or the PowerShell installer for `irm`/`iwr`. Use it as
  `curl -fsSL https://get-stackql-deploy.io/install | sh` (Linux/macOS) or
  `irm https://get-stackql-deploy.io/install | iex` (Windows).
- `GET /install.sh` - always the POSIX `sh` installer. Runs `uname` client-side
  to pick the right OS + arch asset.
- `GET /install.ps1` - always the PowerShell installer. Downloads and expands the
  Windows zip into the current directory.
- Any other path - `301`-redirects to `https://stackql-deploy.io`.

### Wrong-shell guards

The installers give friendly guidance instead of cryptic interpreter errors when
run in the wrong shell:

- Fetch `/install.sh` with PowerShell -> served a short PowerShell message
  pointing at `irm .../install.ps1 | iex`.
- Fetch `/install.ps1` with curl/wget -> served a short `sh` message pointing at
  `curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sh`.
- `install.sh` run in a POSIX shell on Windows (Git Bash/MSYS - `uname` reports
  `MINGW*`/`MSYS*`/`CYGWIN*`) -> message pointing at the PowerShell command.
- `install.ps1` run under PowerShell on macOS/Linux (`$PSVersionTable.Platform`
  is `Unix`) -> message pointing at the `sh` command.
- Unsupported CPU architectures get a "no prebuilt binary for your CPU" message
  with a link to the releases page, not "unsupported".

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # wrangler dev - serves on http://localhost:8787
```

Test locally:

```sh
curl -A "curl/8.4.0" http://localhost:8787/install            # -> sh installer
curl -A "WindowsPowerShell/5.1" http://localhost:8787/install  # -> PowerShell installer
curl -A "WindowsPowerShell/5.1" http://localhost:8787/install.sh   # -> "use install.ps1" guide
curl -A "curl/8.4.0" http://localhost:8787/install.ps1            # -> "use install.sh" guide
curl -sI -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh)" http://localhost:8787/   # -> 302 to macos asset
curl -sI -A "curl/8.4.0" http://localhost:8787/                # -> 302 to linux asset
```

## Deploy

One-time auth (uses your Cloudflare login):

```sh
npx wrangler login
```

Deploy:

```sh
npm run deploy     # wrangler deploy
```

`wrangler.toml` uses a `custom_domain` route for `get-stackql-deploy.io`. On the
first deploy Wrangler creates and manages the proxied DNS record for the apex
automatically - no manual DNS entry required. The `get-stackql-deploy.io` zone
must already exist in the target Cloudflare account.

Tail live logs:

```sh
npm run tail
```

## Cutover from Deno Deploy

The zone is already on Cloudflare, so cutover is just pointing the apex at the
Worker instead of Deno Deploy.

1. Authenticate and deploy the Worker:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npx wrangler login
   npm run deploy
   ```

   Confirm the build output reports the route
   `get-stackql-deploy.io (custom domain)`.

2. Resolve the apex DNS conflict. On the first deploy the Worker script uploads
   fine but the custom-domain trigger fails with a `409 Conflict` on
   `.../domains/records` and the output reads `No targets deployed` - because the
   apex still holds the old Deno Deploy record. To clear it:
   - Cloudflare dashboard -> `get-stackql-deploy.io` zone -> DNS -> Records.
   - Delete the old Deno record on the apex (name `get-stackql-deploy.io` / `@`) -
     a `CNAME` to `<project>.deno.dev`, or `A`/`AAAA` records. Note it first if you
     want a rollback path.
   - Re-run `npm run deploy`. Wrangler now creates its own managed proxied record
     and attaches the custom domain; the output should report
     `get-stackql-deploy.io (custom domain)`.

   Deleting the apex record briefly takes the hostname offline until the redeploy
   attaches the Worker (seconds on Cloudflare). To avoid any gap, instead use
   Workers & Pages -> get-stackql-deploy -> Settings -> Domains & Routes -> Add ->
   Custom Domain -> `get-stackql-deploy.io`, which prompts to override the existing
   record in a single step.

3. Verify the live site once DNS propagates (usually seconds on Cloudflare):

   ```sh
   curl -sI -A "curl/8.4.0" https://get-stackql-deploy.io/ | grep -i location
   curl -fsSL https://get-stackql-deploy.io/install.sh | head -5
   curl -L https://get-stackql-deploy.io | tar tzf - | head        # full one-liner
   ```

   Confirm responses are served by Cloudflare (response header
   `server: cloudflare`) and not Deno Deploy.

4. Decommission the Deno Deploy project once verified: delete or pause it in the
   Deno Deploy dashboard so it no longer bills or risks serving stale content.
   The previous Deno source lives in git history if you ever need it.

No consumers need changing - `get-stackql-deploy.io`, `/install.sh`, and the
`curl | tar` one-liner all keep the same URLs and behaviour.
